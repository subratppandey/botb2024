Project Title: Implementation of video recommendation algorithm for NFL+ Platinum subscribers.

Project Description: The project aims to enhance the NFL fan experience through AI-driven solutions, including a generative chatbot for personalized content and a platform for short-form NFL videos. By leveraging AI technology, the project seeks to increase user engagement and attract new subscribers to elevate the NFL+ platform and drive revenue growth for the NFL.

Installation/Setup: This project requires Python and the following Python libraries installed:

1. NumPy
2. Pandas
3. scikit-learn
4. pip
   
You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook.

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.

Code: 

Template code is provided in the NFLVideoRecommender.ipynb notebook file. You will also be required to use the included content_pool.csv, enhanced_nfl_user_preferences.csv, and nfl_video_rec_pool.csv file to complete your work. While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality when requested to successfully complete the project. 

How to Run the Project:

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory and run one of the following commands:

1. ipython notebook NFLVideoRecommender.ipynb
                      or,
2. jupyter notebook NFLVideoRecommender.ipynb

Running these commands will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.

Data:

The modified Boston housing dataset consists of data points from three different CSV files that we have trained through our Machine Learning Models. For real-life purposes, we will be incorporating the field data obtained from NFL's database to scale the project and work on optimization of ML models in the future.
